# Character Creation System for DarkRP

This script is a basic functioning character system for Garry's Mod DarkRP. It allows up to a maximum of three separate characters per steamid. Each player has their own unique job, pocket, and wallet associated with their character. All this data is persistent through disconnects, which allows players to pickup where they left off. This script utilizes SQLite for a lightweight and quick method for insert and updating player data tables on the server. Below are some of the features implemented in this script.

* Enforces roleplay names, without special characters/symbols.
* Bad word filter for player names.
* Pockets are saved per character.
* ULX Support for commands.
* Ban/Unban characters from being played. ('Offline)
* Kick player from current job.
* Delete characters ('Offline)
* Persistent playermodels for donators
